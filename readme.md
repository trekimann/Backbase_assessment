# Overview
The goal of the technical test is to create a Java web application.

The application should Indicate whether a movie won a “Best Picture” Oscar, given a
movie’s title based on this [API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and the enclosed CSV file that contains winners from
1927 until 2010. It should also allow users to give a rating to movies and provide a list
of 10 top-rated movies ordered by box office value.

# Solution
* The code and the deliverables should be production-ready
* Here you have the Backbase stack: [Backbase - Backbase Tech Stack](https://stackshare.io/backbase/backbase) our services
are built mainly using Java 11, Spring and Maven. If you do not have experience
in these frameworks, please feel free to use any other alternative, we will review
the proper use of any framework or library included..

As mentioned, your proposed solution should be production-ready and should be easily
understandable by another developer, colleague or customer, so please make sure you
include the following documentation.
* ## [solution.md](/src/main/documentation/solution.md)
A short (min two lines, max half a page) description of the solution and explaining some design decisions
* ## [how_to_run.md](/src/main/documentation/how_to_run.md)
A short explanation about how to run the solution with all the needed parts
* ## [how_to_test.md](/src/main/documentation/how_to_test.md)
File explaining what needs to be done to use the service.
* ## [to_do.md](/src/main/documentation/to_do.md)
to-do list with things you would add if you have more time or explaining what is missing and why etc
* ## [assumptions.md](/src/main/documentation/assumptions.md)
Your assumptions when solving the challenge
* ## [scale.md](/src/main/documentation/scale.md) 
A description of how it will scale when the number of users/agents/consumers grows from 100 per day to 10000000 per day, and what changes would have to be made to keep the same quality of service.

* ## Diagrams
Any diagram you believe would be useful, more if you find it necessary:
 * system-context-diagram – a system context diagram (UML, whiteboard
jpg photo, 8-bit pixel art gif, a phone picture of a bar's paper napkin with a
crayon diagram scrawled on it, anything is good as long as it's legible)
* entity-diagram
* component-diagram
* class-diagram
* data-flow-diagram
* sequence-diagram

If you can explain everything without diagrams or images, go ahead!

# Time allotted for completion
There aren’t any formal requirements for how long this challenge should take you,
complete it in ten minutes or ten hours, it’s up to you. We suggest keeping it to a
maximum of a couple of days.

# Requirements
* Your solution should include an API
* Your solution is able to persist and retrieve data from a real database
* Your API needs to expect an API token from the caller

# Suggestion
Keep it simple. Part of the evaluation consists of being able to follow the requirements,
and not over-engineer the solution.
